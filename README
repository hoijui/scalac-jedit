Scala plugin for jEdit 1.1.0
Vlad Seryakov vseryakov@gmail.com

Introduction
------------------

This plugin makes the development similar to C/C++ or other scripting environment, 
i.e. it does not use any package manager or build tool. It assumes that all .jar 
files are put in special library directory manually, this is the simplest mode 
of operation.

Of course, it is possible to specify custom directories and classpath and the plugin
will discover .jar files automatically, but because at this moment settings are global, 
if you switch between several projects very frequently, some kind of project specific 
facility will make life easier. Currently it requires to change paths manually for 
every compilation if it is different.

So, if you know all .jar files needed for your project, they do not change often, 
just copy then into Scala lib/ for example, which makes using scala interpreter 
without problem because it loads all .jars from the lib/ automatically.

See index.html for more information about installation and usage of the plugin.

Features
------------------

- Scala syntax highlighting
- Embedded Scala compiler, results in very fast compilation
- Simple project strucutre convention, uses default directories
- Recursively adds all .jar files in the classpaths
- Recursively adds all Scala source files
- Supports Liftweb project development structure
- Embeds Jetty Web server for Liftweb development
- Embedded Jetty automatically scans for newly compiled classes
  and restarts Web server automatically
- Creates simple Liftweb application structure

See index.html for details

Compilation and installation
-------------------------------

To build

 # and

it will create ScalacPlugin.jar with Scala compiler because compiler requires 
classes to be available during startup and compilation. Instead of using 
bootstrapping we just combine Scala compiler and Jetty server with our plugin
and install into local jEdit directory.
